# Portfolio
A sampling of work I have done during a computer science degree program and other musings.

- Circular buffer is a configurable string buffer that stores a configurable number of items. Once the items are added and the buffer is full, it will begin writing over it's oldest member.
  - Compile and run Solution.java

- Kruskal is an implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree using disjoint sets. The input is configurable in two files. One for a list of points with relative locations and the other for distances between locations. 
  - Compile and run MNKruskal.java
 
- Linked list in C is just that. Heckofajob

- Shared Bathroom Threading problem is an elaborated solution to the multiple gender bathroom sharing problem with a third impatient gender of Zombie thrown into the mix.
  - Compile and run BathroomProblem.java to see. It is solved using several different locking mechanism.
 
 - Tree Builder will show you a tree-i-fied version of your typing on the fly.
   - Compile and run test.java to see it.
  
- Virtual memory is a Memory Management Module simulator in java. It maps physical memory to virtual memory and implements a paging system that writes blocks to disk when physical memory is reallocated. 
  - Compile and run Test.java to see it.
